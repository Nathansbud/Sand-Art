<h1> Sand Art </h1>
**By Zachary Amiton**
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> Hey! Ever had that creative urge you just couldn't scratch? Longed for the days when, as a child (granted, your childhood may not have ended yet) you could play with sand on the beach without feeling like it was a waste of time? Well, look no further! SandArt is here! This program is a tool in which you can do just that: play with sand. So strap in folks, it's time to pretend you're sitting on the beach; let's make it rain sand!</p>

<h2> Getting Started </h2>

<p> Please note, the Minim library is required to run this project. However, since the only functionality using this is the Music Player, if you can live without sweet tunes and are too lazy to download Minim, feel free to comment any music-related chunks out. Otherwise, a link to it can be found <a href = "https://github.com/ddf/Minim">here</a>.

<p> In essence, this project is fairly simple: hit run, and you will be greeted with a blank canvas. Simply hold down the mouse, and pieces of sand will be drawn. You can also use the color selectors in the top left in order to change your color (the default in black). If you've messed up, chosen a wrong color, or generally aren't happy (or everything is lagging, due to less-than-stellar optomization), hitting the delete key will clear all sand off the screen, and will return sand color to black.</p>

<p> In addition, though a WIP (along with the rest of the project, in all honesty), there is also an accessable settings menu in the top right corner. Simply click on "Settings," and the menu should pop up. At the moment, you can choose to adjust gravity (the speed at which the sand falls), setting it to Off, Low, Medium, or High. The same is also true for the size (radius) of the sand particles, with options for Mini, Small, Medium, and Large. Wind Speed, while present, currently does nothing. </p>

<p> And if you're all set, feel free to click on the play button to start some sweet, sweet tunes as well. Rewind functionality is currently not present, nor is selection from a music library (such as iTunes). All in due time, I guess? In the mean time, make do with the songs bundled with the project (or don't, I guess). </p>

<h2> Inspiration </h2>

<p> My inspiration for this project came largely—if not entirely—from an incredibly neat website called <a href = "http://thisissand.com"> Thisissand </a>. Go check it out, their website is far more advanced than this project. The inspiration (is that we're calling copying these days?) should be pretty obvious. Personally, it was a very interesting feeling to be able to look at something and say, "Hey, maybe I could replicate that. It may not be as good (yet...!), but I bet I could make a fair bit of progress." But yeah, really neat site, very easy-to-use interface, though everything kind of just becomes a mountain. Fun nonetheless!
